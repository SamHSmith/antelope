# antilope
A vulkan renderer in rust on top of [Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano)

## No longer being worked on
Working on this project partly because of a flawed design and too tight intercoupling with Winit. Forking this project and developing it yourself is greatly encouraged.

The glfw branch is the the branch that works because it's been moved to my crossvulkan library.

# DO NOT USE THIS. The words above are the words of an imbecile. Forking this project is an act of lunacy.
